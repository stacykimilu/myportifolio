            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Stacy Kimilu.A Future fashion,beauty and Tech mogul.
                Born and raised in NAIROBI,KENYA.I am a creative enthusiast with a passion for self-expression and exploration.
                Hello there! I'm [Your Name], a passionate individual with a zest for life and a deep commitment to making a positive impact in the world.
                Originally from [Your City/Country], I've always been drawn to exploration and discovery, whether it's through trying out new recipes in the
                kitchen, experimenting with makeup looks, or embarking on adventures to far-off destinations.My love for baking runs deep, as there's 
                something truly magical about combining ingredients and creating delicious treats that bring joy to others. Whether it's whipping up a batch 
                of homemade cookies or crafting an elaborate cake for special occasions, I find solace and satisfaction in the art of baking. 
                In addition to my culinary pursuits, I have a passion for makeup and beauty. I see makeup as a form of self-expression and creativity,
                 allowing me to enhance my natural features and experiment with different looks. From bold and dramatic to soft and subtle, each makeup
                application is an opportunity to embrace my individuality and celebrate my unique style.Traveling is another one of my great loves,
                 as it allows me to immerse myself in new cultures, connect with people from diverse backgrounds, and explore the beauty and wonders of 
                 the world. Whether it's wandering through bustling markets in foreign cities, soaking up the sun on exotic beaches, or trekking through 
                 breathtaking landscapes, I'm always eager to embark on new adventures and create lasting memories.Beyond my personal interests, I am deeply 
                 passionate about mental health advocacy and promoting emotional well-being. As someone who has experienced the challenges of mental health 
                 issues firsthand, I am committed to raising awareness, reducing stigma, and supporting others on their journey to mental wellness.I am also 
                 a religious person, finding strength and guidance in my faith. My spiritual beliefs serve as a source of comfort, hope, and inspiration, 
                 grounding me in times of uncertainty and guiding me towards a life of purpose and fulfillment. Ultimately, I am a lover of life, embracing 
                 each day with gratitude, enthusiasm, and a sense of wonder. Whether I'm in the kitchen baking up a storm, experimenting with new makeup 
                 looks, jet-setting to far-off destinations, advocating for mental health awareness, or finding solace in my faith, I strive to live 
                 authentically and make a positive difference in the world around me.
                For the love of programming i would love to use my skills to solve problems and create application that make life convinient.

                <li>Makeup</li>
                <p>Here's a description you could use to express "Makeup" as a skill within an "About Me" section:

                    "As a makeup enthusiast and artist, I see beauty as a form of self-expression and empowerment. With a passion for color theory and an eye for detail, 
                    I transform faces into canvases, enhancing natural features and creating stunning looks that reflect individuality and confidence. From subtle enhancements

                      color palettes that complement any occasion or mood. Whether it's for a special event, a photoshoot, or simply to boost self-confidence, I believe in 
                      the transformative power of makeup to inspire and uplift. Through my artistry, I aim to celebrate beauty in all its forms and empower 
                      others to embrace their unique essence."</p>

                <h3>EAT IT: Restaurant Recommendation and Reservation System </h3>
                <p>-The system was designed to help customers by suggesting restaurants of similar type, reservations 
                    according to price and ratings within the vicinity of the application user.
                    The three main actors are the customers, the administrator and the restaurant owner. The
                    customer logins into the system. The customer receives a list of restaurants that are according
                    to his budget. They pick the restaurant and begin to enter the details, date and time of
                    reservation of the table space and confirm the reservation. The administrator will be able to
                    add users and add the reservation details. The client receives a notification that the
                    reservation has been received. The restaurant owner will be able to accept and view the
                    reservation that have already been made. The main deliverable in our case is to create and
                    provide the application to be used by each and every individual. This system will enable
                    customers to reserve table space according to their convenience
